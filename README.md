# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissor game written in JavaScript. Part of The Odin Project.

# How to Play
You will be playing against the computer. To play this game, open up the HTML page in the browser. Open up the browser JavaScript console (commonly by hitting F-12 and navigating to the console). You will need to call the 'playGame()' function and pass your choice of 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. The console will then display the winner of that round.

If you want to play multiple games, you can call the 'playSeries()' function, again passing either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
The program will keep track of the overall winner at the end of five rounds and display the winner.
